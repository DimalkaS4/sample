# DianEro Website

This is a premium, animated website for the DianEro brand, featuring a Virtual Try-On experience.

## Virtual Try-On Feature
The Virtual Try-On feature uses advanced image processing (Canvas API) to repaint the t-shirt color on the model.

**IMPORTANT:**
Due to browser security restrictions (CORS), the Virtual Try-On feature **will not work** if you simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser. The browser will block access to the image data.

**To use the Virtual Try-On:**
1.  Open this folder in VS Code.
2.  Install the **Live Server** extension.
3.  Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
4.  The site will open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/` and the try-on feature will work perfectly.
